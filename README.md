# Work-it-Serve-it-Eat-it
Project of Ming Lu & Amélie Schroeder

This project was created during the Impuls Workshop III, BA Visual Communication and Digital Spaces, at HGK Basel FHNW, 2025.

“Work It, Serve It, Eat It” is an interactive performance project that combines physical cooking with digital design. Inspired by the bird’s-eye-view format of YouTube cooking shows, we challenged ourselves to create a sandwich in a specific time frame while showcasing the Supreme typeface. As ingredients are prepared and assembled, our digital interface responds in real-time, reacting to AprilTags, audio levels, and colors. This fusion of culinary action and typographic design transforms a simple 9-step sandwich-making process into an immersive, time-based experience that bridges the tactile and the digital.

Creative Direction: Studio Unstated
